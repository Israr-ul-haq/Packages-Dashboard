## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
You will need Node JS Installed.

## Deployment
Deployment on a local PC:

Download All the files of the repo or make a clone of the repo by using git clone https://github.com/Jinnbyte/naurri-dashboard.git

Deployment online:

Let’s assume we bought the domain “naurri.com”.
We will also need to rent a web-server and bandwidth from a hosting service.
The hosting service will give us access to the server, where we can upload files and install custom scripts to keep our site up and running.
Then npm run build to build a optimized version of the project. The build folder will be created in the root directory of your project.
Make a zip of the folder and upload it to the web server that you bought.
Your all done!.

## Built With
NodeJS - The package manager used in our project
